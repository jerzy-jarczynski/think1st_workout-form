# Workout Form

This is a React project aimed at creating a Workout Form application. The application allows users to sign up for training sessions by filling out a form. It consists of two main parts: Personal Info Form and Workout Form. The Personal Info Form collects basic personal information such as first name, last name, email address, age, and allows users to upload a photo. The Workout Form includes a calendar where users can select a date, upon which a time selector appears.

## Issues

At this point, I haven't been able to find any errors or issues with the application and form functionality, except for minor frontend imperfections (pixel perfect). The application lacks grandeur (special effects), but it was created with attention to detail.

It's worth noting that no ready-made component libraries were used in the code, which significantly extended the development and debugging process. The code is quite chaotic. It was created in haste and with considerable assistance from ChatGPT 3.5. Nonetheless, I am satisfied with the final result.

> Note: A correctly filled out form sends data to the specified endpoint in the recruitment task, which is fictional, but I haven't added any success message other than console.log.

To see the effect of the submitted form, press F12 in your browser, navigate to the console, and then click "Send application."
